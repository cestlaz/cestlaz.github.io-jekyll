The StuyCS Semi Formal, Clyde "Thluffy" Sinclair, and other assorted
[[http://cestlaz.github.io/2015/03/08/antother-day-stuycs.html#.VXmHfN_08bw][silliness]] - one of the reasons StuyCS is a family is that we try to
have fun.

Jazz Hands day was the latest.

I got the idea at JonAlf's wedding. The wait staff were all wearing
white gloves - all of a sudden it hit me - Jazz Hands!!!! and Jazz
Hands day was born. 

The idea:

All of our Junior and Senior CS students, around 350 or so, along with
their teachers would wear white gloves on a specified day. The rules
were throughout the day, in any class, provided there were two or more
CS Jazz Hands students in the class, whenever:
- a student gave a good thoughtful answer to a question
- or the teacher made a particularly strong point

The kids would give a Jazz Hands salute.

Imagine, some kid gives a great answer and 1/3 of the class all of a
sudden does Jazz Hands!!!!

Unfortunately, this was an event that I wouldn't actually be able to
see as the havoc would be wreaked in other classes.

By the time we got to the end of the day, I knew we were on to
something.

Word on the street was that a bunch of teachers thought it was
hilarious. Apparently one teacher pulled the math chair into her class
so she could see.

Then we had at least a few teachers that didn't get into the spirit
and actually lodged complaints.

Let's see, we had students, via a non-verbal form of feedback,
indicate that they were totally engaged by acknowledging what they
felt was a good point. 

Disruptive?

Imagine that.

I don't know what makes me want to fine tune this event more - the
positive feedback or the complaints.
