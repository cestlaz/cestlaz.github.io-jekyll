Yesterday, my buddy [[https://twitter.com/snikolov][Stan]] pointed me to this article: 
[[http://arstechnica.com/business/2014/12/to-address-techs-diversity-woes-start-with-the-vanishing-comp-sci-classroom/]["To address techâ€™s diversity woes, start with the vanishing Comp Sci classroom"]]

It gives a reasonable overview of the gender issues in computer
science education. The article talks about the drop in popularity of
the old Advanced Placement AB course and its eventually being dropped
as well as thoughts on how the current A course is pretty dry.

It made me think about the old vs new exams. The current APCS A exam
is roughly analogous to a typical college 101 course: programming in
one language and one paradigm. The old AB class represented a 101 and
a 102 with the 102 being data structures and algorithms. Much more
interesting for both guys and girls. Over the years, the AP A exam has
become more and more vocational, at least in my opinion, and that
makes matters worse. Its more and more about using the language and
built in collections and less about thinking and problem
solving. What's fun about that?

Of course, we teach our version, a super-set, of the AB curriculum over
the course of a school year.

Interesting that even though we teach that old school hardcore CS, we
far exceed the national numbers in terms of gender balance, but more
on that later.

One of the big things going on right now is the AP CS Principles
course. There's some good stuff in there but I've got a lot of
questions. 

To start, I'm tired of hearing that it's a college level course. If
a course is designed so that a 10th grader can be successful, it's not
college level. I do understand that it's being taught in places like
Berekely (and as an aside I both like and greatly respect Dan Garcia,
who's the architect of one version of CS principles - the Beauty and
Joy of Computing, and his work). If my kids were doing in college what
they could have been doing in 10th grade, something's wrong. That's
not to say that you can't have a similar course at both levels, just
that there's a **huge** difference between a 10th grader and a college
freshman. 

I also take issue with the drag and drop languages in high school and
beyond. True, there's a low cost of entry, but then it's limiting in
oh so many ways. Much slower than a keyboard interface, limited screen
real estate, and no clear exit to traditional textual
programming. Scratch and the like are probably good for younger kids,
but I've had to rescue many a kid from the damage done by drag and
drop. I'm not advocating starting a high schooler in Haskell with Vim
but there are plenty of tools that are both accessible, easy entry,
fun, but at the same time real.

We also see the proliferation of all girl after school programs. I
don't have any problem with this per se. I think we need some all
girls and some co-ed. In fact, one of the young ladies in our summer
program commented on how much she liked the fact that we weren't all
girls but we created a wonderful environment where everyone felt
comfortable and supported. 

Some of those programs do great things in terms of exposing girls to
role models and to what's possible. My issue is with the actual
education, notably because these programs invariably don't have real
educator/computer scientists running the show. They teach a watered
down CS or conversely too much too quickly and then the girls are
clobbered at the next level, they start doubting themselves and they
change majors.

The problems with these after school programs as well as with CS
Principles are the same. A few of my students who studied CS at
Harvard framed it nicely when talking about Harvard's highly
publicized CS50 course (I'm paraphrasing and combining thoughts here):

#+begin_quote
They don't really teach anything, you've got to do it mostly on your
own. In the end you don't really learn anything.

Then, they go on to Harvard's next real CS class - functional
programming with no real preparation and they drop like flies.
#+end_quote

So, what do you do?

You do what we did.

I developed an intro course over 10 years ago. The new AP Principles
course has some overlap in terms of concepts but one big difference is
that we dive into programming using two real languages. [[http://racket-lang.org/][Scheme]], which
is mathy functional and [[https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/index.shtml][NetLogo]] which is visual and interactive but
still text based. We then move on to a number of really neat concepts
in Python. 

People say, "Oh, you do the NetLogo because it's visual and appeals to
girls." No - we do NetLogo because it's cool and it appeals to
kids. Same with Scheme. Show me a girl that loves the visual stuff,
I'll show you a girl that loves Scheme's functional goodness. I might
only be a dopey old school teacher, but I really believe "kids are
kids."

On top of this, you get great teachers that really know their stuff
(and we've built plenty of them over the years) and create a culture
with everyone's accepted and good things happen.

By the time our kids leave us, they've got enough under their belts so
they not only know their stuff but they have the confidence that they
know their stuff. 

How does it work for us? Nationally, about 19% of APCS test takers are
women. At Stuy, we hover around 30%. My Software Development, Post AP
classes are also around 30% so we keep them. Oh, and Stuy is only 40%
female and we do much worse than the national averages in other
traditionally male dominated fields such as physics.

Yesterday, I was talking to one of our CSTUY hackers as we ended the
day. We were talking about possible directions to go in after the new
year. We could stay graphical, go to text processing, look at some
hardcore algorithms and more. I asked Aruna what she thought. Her
answer: "It's all fun."
