# The Problem: 


The buzz word is "accountability." Why are teachers special? Why don't
they feel they need to be evaluated like other professionals? Why do
they feel they need a "job for life?"

Of course, the job for life line is nonsense -- teachers have tenure,
but that's just due process - not a guarantee of a job.

Friends in the private sector ask "if a teacher is doing a good job,
why do they need tenure? In the private sector as long as you're
producing, you've got nothing to worry about."

Well, first I dispute that last sentence. second, K-12 education isn't
the real world. It's rife with stories of administrators that go after
teachers for no apparent reason. Why? Because accountability doesn't
mean accountability - it means we can fire teachers at will. No one
wants accountability to apply to anyone except the ground troops. I
don't have an exact attribution, but Mayor Bloomberg is frequently
quoted as stating "If parent's don't like the way I run the schools,
they can boo me at parades."

Beyond that, the powers that be state that teacher accountability
revolves around flawed "value added" metrics but other bloggers such as Gary
Rubintein have already done a great job debunking that.

# The Solution:


The solution is to simplify. There's a better way. Let's start by
making the principals accountable. Bottom line is that they're
responsible for a school's success. If the school doesn't cut the
mustard, then they're out. But, how do we measure this?

High Schools
------------

How do we tell if a high school is a success? Simple -- one year and
two years after graduation determine how many kids are either in college or
gainfully employed. There should be a way to get this info - state tax
records maybe? If a high school starts with 60% of its students at
grade level, about 60% of that cohort should be in college or working
a year or two after graduation - simple. If the percent goes up, even better.

Middle Schools
--------------

Even easier here -- track the kids into high school. If kids are doing
comparably well in 9th and 10th grades, its a fair bet that the feeder
middle schools are doing pretty well. By 11th or 12th grade, the
results are probably more due to the high school. The system will lose
some kids to private schools or families moving, but it should still
be a pretty good measure.

Elementary Schools
------------------

Same thing -- look at the middle schools. 

# The end game


With this measure in mind we can truly hold a principal
accountable. By looking at a bottom line measure, the principal can
staff and evaluate their schools as they see fit. Teachers don't have
to teach to the test or have their creativity destroyed by
standardized lessons -- as long as they get results, a principal would
want them.

# The Positives


* It's simple 
* It allows for tremendous flexibility within a school
* It measures bottom line success, not arbitrary test results
* It doesn't require huge contracts with private companies like Pearson
 
# The Negatives
    l

* We still need to have enough structure to make sure kids get a well
  rounded education and are not just "job shops."  

* Related, we have to make sure offerings such as art and music don't
  fall to the wayside, but then, they're currently first on the
  chopping blocks.

* Very high performing schools such as Stuyvesant would need a
  modified metric.
