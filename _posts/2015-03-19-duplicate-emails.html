Quick post on why I love the Unix command line.
</p>

<p>
We're busy organizing <a href="http://cstuy.org">CSTUY's</a> first <a href="http://cstuy.org/programs/defhacks">hackathon</a>. It's going to be at
<a href="http://sumall.com">SumAll</a>, where we hold our weekly <a href="http://cstuy.org/programs/hacking_sessions">hacking sessions</a> but while taking
registration, we had a little program.
</p>

<p>
The kids signed up on a Google doc but we all know the story &#x2013; when
people sign up for a free event, even one with free food and t-shirts,
many don't show. I asked all of the applicants to confirm by filling
out a second Google doc.
</p>

<p>
Then it got to reminder time - I wanted to send an email out to all
those kids who signed up on the first form, but hadn't confirmed on
the second. 
</p>

<p>
Two Google spreadsheets with an email field. I needed all the people
on sheet 1 that weren't on sheet 2. I'm sure there's some
spreadsheet-fu that accomplishes this, but nothing I know. I also
could have written a little python script which isn't so bad, but this
was a perfect time to turn to the shell.
</p>

<p>
So, here's how a command line guy would do this.
</p>

<p>
To start, I put the emails in two files: e1 and e2. The first has
all the original applicants, the second those that confirmed.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-org">|---------+---------|
| e1      | e2      |
|---------+---------|
| a@a.com | b@b.com |
| b@b.com | F@f.com |
| c@c.com | c@c.com |
| d@d.com | d@d.com |
| e@e.com |         |
| f@f.com |         |
| g@g.com |         |
| h@h.com |         |
|---------+---------|
</pre>
</div>


<p>
If we put these lists together, any email that appears twice would
indicate that it's the email of someone that confirmed entry. Here we
use cat to catenate e1 and e2 and pipe them through sort.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-bash">cat e1 e2 | sort
</pre>
</div>

<p>
First problem &#x2013;the upper case F &#x2013; let's use <b><b>tr</b></b> to make
everything lower case:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-bash">cat e1 e2 |  tr A-Z a-z | sort
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Now we can see the duplicates next to each other. Next, <b><b>uniq
-c</b></b> tells us how many times each line appears:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-bash">cat e1 e2 | tr A-Z a-z | sort | uniq -c | sort
</pre>
</div>

<p>
I added the sort at the end, but we didn't need it.
</p>

<p>
Here's what we get:
</p>

<p class="verse">
1 a@a.com<br  />
&#xa0;1 c@c.com<br  />
&#xa0;1 c@c.dom<br  />
&#xa0;1 e@e.com<br  />
&#xa0;1 g@g.com<br  />
&#xa0;1 h@hc.om<br  />
&#xa0;2 b@b.com<br  />
&#xa0;2 d@d.com<br  />
&#xa0;2 f@f.com<br  />
</p>

<p>
To pull out the ones that haven't replied I used egrep with a regex
that means "any line that starts with 1 or more spaces followed by the
number 1":
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-bash">cat e1 e2 | tr A-z a-z | sort | uniq -c | egrep "^ +1"
</pre>
</div>

<p>
and finally to isolate the emails using sed which removes the spaces
and number 1 from the beginning of the line:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-bash">cat e1 e2 | tr A-z a-z | sort | uniq -c | egrep "^ +1" | sed "s/\ \+1 //g"
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Each of the little utilities aren't all too useful by themselves but
if you learn them over time you start thinking about how you can
combine them to solve problems. 
</p>

<p>
If you think this way and know some basic tools, all of a sudden all
manner of text manipulation problems become pretty easy.
