This past week, Garth Flint wrote a couple of posts on how he
got to be a CS teacher and on being a CS teacher. You can find them here:

- [[https://gflint.wordpress.com/2015/10/08/so-you-want-to-be-a-cs-teacher-part-2/][Part 2]]

They're both well worth a read.

It got me thinking about how I got my start.

I never planned on being a teacher. I figured I'd just work in
tech. After working my way through college, fresh CS degree in hand, I
landed at Goldman Sachs. I had other opportunities but the tech scene
was very different. You could (basically):
- Work for a financial house or insurance company
- Do niche consulting
- travel out of the city to Bellcore, AT&T or IBM.

Well, I didn't drive and wasn't going to do consulting so I ended up
on Wall Street.
