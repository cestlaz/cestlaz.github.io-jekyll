I was brought up on Gilberg and Sullvan. My father, who always wanted
to be an opera singer sang with [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_Opera_of_Manhattan][LOOM]] back in the day and there was
always classical music playing. Either from the Hi Fi or my father
singing.

Recently, there's been a kerfufle over what was to be [[http://nygasp.org][NYGASP's]]
production of Mikado.

My son, Natan write a terrific plog post on it and the suspension of
belief in opera. It's long but well worth a read.

If you like G&S or opera in general, take a look.

It can be found [[http://seccorecit.blogspot.com/2015/09/imagine-if-you-will.html][here]].

Enjoy.
