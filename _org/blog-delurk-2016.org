It's been pointed out by a couple of bloggers I follow:
 - [[https://gasstationwithoutpumps.wordpress.com/][Gas station without pumps]]
 - [[http://blog.acthompson.net/][Computer Science Teacher (Alfred Thompson's blog)]]

That it's International Blog Delurking Week.

So, I know I don't have a large readership, but if you do read this
 blog, why not give a brief hi in the comments.  I'd love to know who you are and what you do.
