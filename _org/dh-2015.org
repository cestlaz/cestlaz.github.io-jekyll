This past Saturday, 50 high school students, 10 high school mentors, and 10
more post high school mentors headed down to [[sumall.com][SumAll]] to participate in
**def hacks(2015):** [[cstuy.org][CSTUY]]'s first hackathon.

The fifty participants, came from all over the city, Long Island, and
New Jersey. They ranged from having never programmed to three or four
years experience. 

Projects ranged from web sites to full stack applications. 

* 
After workshops run by CSTUY teachers and mentors and also by
[[http://codesters.com][Codesters.com]] the hackers spread out all over SumAll's offices, working in small
groups with the support of our amazing mentors.

In the end everyone made something terrific and walked away having
built new skills, met new people, and gotten a little swag.

The judges singled out two groups for special
recognition. One was a team of four experienced programmers who put
together a full stack app to help schedule parent/teacher meetings.

The other was a solo project from a young man who had never programmed
prior to the event.

That one really blew me away. We were able to give these groups
Raspberry Pis thanks to a last minute donation from [[http://www.fullstackacademy.com/][Fullstack Academy]].

None of this would have been possible without the help of:

Our organizers - Caitlin and Lise
