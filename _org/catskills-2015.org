The Hudson Valley's a beutiful place, particularly during the Fall.
We don't get up there as much as we should - usually just for apple
picking and then for [[http://sheepandwool.com/][the New York Sheep and Wool Festival]].

It's a region with great food, hiking, natural beauty, history and more.

So, what exactly is growing?

The Hudson Valley Tech community.

I first heard about what Hudson Valley was doing around Tech back at the Augsust
[[http://nytm.tumblr.com/post/125527139762/august-2015-nytm-lineup][New York Tech Meetup]]. I was there with my students showing off their work.

That's where I met [[https://twitter.com/kalekaposhilin?ref_src=twsrc%255Egoogle%257Ctwcamp%255Eserp%257Ctwgr%255Eauthor][Kale Kaposhilin]] - one of the organizers of the
[[http://www.meetup.com/hvtech/][Hudson Valley Tech Meetup]].  I later reconnected with a former student
[[https://twitter.com/aq?ref_src=twsrc%255Egoogle%257Ctwcamp%255Eserp%257Ctwgr%255Eauthor][Aaron Quint]] who is also very involved in Tech in Ulster County.

Kale, Aaron, and others hosted an amazing event last week. Something
of a coming out party for tech in the Hudson Vallyue - [[http://catskillsconf.com][CatskillsConf]].

Catskills Conf was a tech conference but it's not your regular tech
conference. Sure, it had tech speakers like John Resig and [[https://twitter.com/dens?ref_src=twsrc%255Egoogle%257Ctwcamp%255Eserp%257Ctwgr%255Eauthor][Dennis
Crowley]]. I brought up some students to show off their work and I gave
a short rant on CS education. Sounds techie enough.

But Catskillsconf was special. Hosted at the [[http://ashokancenter.org/][Ashokan Center]], an
educational retreat, we all stayed bunkhouses together, ate together,
and pretty much felt like we were in summer camp - and I mean that in
the best way.

Since we were all on site, nobody left in the evenings. We had live
music, square dancing (what better way to get a group of A-social
techies to mix), a live bird of prey show and [[https://twitter.com/songadaymann?ref_src=twsrc%255Egoogle%257Ctwcamp%255Eserp%257Ctwgr%255Eauthor][Jonathan Mann]], our very
own songwriter recapping each day:

Then we had the workshops. Sure we had tech - wearables and drones,
but personally, I had more fun at the blacksmithing and ukelele
sessions.

I think the biggest thing of all was that it felt like a community was
building. It wasn't like your usual conference where you might know a
few people and then force yourself to meet a few more. I'm looking for
a better word, but for lack of one, it was comfortable.

Hats off to Kale, Aaron, and the team for setting the stage and thanks
to everyone there - organizers, particpants, staff, and volunteers we all made it an unbelievable experience.

Can't wait until next year.
