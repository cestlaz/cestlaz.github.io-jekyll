A fascinating question raised in my CS Ed Research class this morning:
Has anyone tracked to see if having CS/IT professionals visit
classrooms (e.g., like with TEALS) leads to recruiting *more* teachers
out of the classroom and into industry? We think about the
professionals coming into the classroom to get the students to think
"Hey, I could do that!" Might it not have the same effect on the CS
*teachers*?
