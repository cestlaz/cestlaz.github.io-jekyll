The other week, I noticed this Twitter conversation beetween <a href="http://twitter.com/alfredtwo">Alfred Thompson</a>  and <a href="http://twitter.com/keinath">Steve Keinath</a>
<p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>I&#39;d love to see an Intro to Linux (way more than just install) as a 3-hour workshop at <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23CSTA14&amp;src=hash">#CSTA14</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/csteachersa">@csteachersa</a></p>&mdash; Steve Keinath (@keinath) <a href="https://twitter.com/keinath/statuses/400333558603997184">November 12, 2013</a></blockquote><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/alfredtwo">@alfredtwo</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/csteachersa">@csteachersa</a> Right. I know very little &amp; would love a &quot;zero to hero&quot; Linux workshop.</p>&mdash; Steve Keinath (@keinath) <a href="https://twitter.com/keinath/statuses/400335634297937920">November 12, 2013</a></blockquote>

I briefly considered proposing a session bit it was just a day or two before the deadline, I don't know if I'm going to be able to attend the conference, and besides, who said anything I proposed would be accepted.
<p>

Still, I liked the idea - I've been an educator for 23 years, a Linux user for most of that time and an  Unix user for longer. I'm a firm believer in operating system as toolkit and so I think I'll take Steve and Alfred's suggestion and try to put together a series of posts on using Linux from a CS educators point of view.
<p>

So, before we begin - a little background.
<p>

I can proudly say that I've been Windows free since about 2000. That's when I decided to wipe the lat traces of Microsoft from my hard drives. Prior to that I just booted up MS-DOS or Windows to play games or to use a Excel or Word.
<p>
Since the early days of linux - back before Slackware, I dual booted. Before Linux, I dialed into public Unix systems such as <a href="http://www.panix.com">Panix</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Electric_Cat">The Big Electric Cat</a>. At home, I tried to make MS-DOS as Unix like as I could. I ran the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MKS_Toolkit">MKS Toolkti</a>, and used my own shell (a project every young programmer should attempt).
<p>

Next time, I'll talk about my current toolkit and how one can get started with Linux.

From there, I'll talk more about the tools I use, my workflow, and just why working in the shell is so cool.
