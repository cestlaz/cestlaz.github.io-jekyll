I replied that this was impossibleâ€”that we could not in three months train non-hackers to have the kind of insights they'd have if they were hackers, because the only way to have those kinds of insights is to actually be a hacker, and that usually takes years.

If someone was going to be really good at programming they would have found it on their own.
I was explaining the distinction between a CS major and a hacker, but taken in isolation it sounds like I'm saying you can't be good at programming unless you start as a kid. I don't think that. In fact I err on the side of late binding for everything, including metiers. What I was talking about here is the idea that to do something well you have to be interested in it for its own sake, not just because you had to pick something as a major. So this is the message to take away:
If you want to be really good at programming, you have to love it for itself.
