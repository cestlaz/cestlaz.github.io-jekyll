The flipped classroom. One of the latest and greatest fads
to save education. 

As a 23 year vet I've lived through any number of educational fads
including multiple intelligences, cooperative learning, constructivism,
the house system, and on and on.

This one, however has me concerned. In the hands of the wrong people
they're making me feel like Burgess Meredith as the Obsolete Man.

The theory is nice -- don't waste the teachers time with
lectures. Have them watch lectures the night before and spend the
class working on problems.

The idea isn't necessarily bad. The danger is that the won't be used
to free up teachers, but rather to cut costs. Give the kids a MOOC, we
don't need a teacher, just a "learning coach." It's similar to the
blended learning bunk.

Besides, it doesn't work. At least not at the high school level.

First, it's not a new idea - us old timers call it homework. Read,
watch, or do something the night before. Maybe it includes a video,
but it could be anything.

Second, as I said, it doesn't work. A frequent criticism of the
flipped classroom is that only the most motivated student will watch
the videos. This certainly is a problem, but there's something bigger.

Let me tell you about an experience my classes recently shared.

My students are bright, motivated, and dedicated. They're a terrific
group. My students needed to set up their home machines for use in our courses.

They also had to set up their accounts in school, which, surprisingly
enough, has to be done at home since our internet connectivity is next
to non existant.

Some kids have Macs, some run Windows, a few Linux. All the machines
at school run Linux and the kids had to ssh in. I provided
instructions and guidance in a number of forms. A step by step
walkthrough, video, a variety of online references. We also have a
mailing list and I'm sure the students have a facebook group.

Also, what they had to do involved following procedures, not deep
understanding or analysis.

The results?
