The other day, Alfred Thompson wrote a post on [Debugging Student
Code](http://blog.acthompson.net/2013/11/debugging-student-code.html). It
got me thinking of a common occurance I've seen over the years:

Students asking the wrong question.

The wrong question?

Just what do I mean by that?

Usually during project time, but throughout the year, students will aske me a coding question. They'll ask things like:

> How do I find the shortest path between two locations, I think it's called Dijkstra's algorithm?

> I need to sort a really large data set on disk by multiple keys.

> 



While I love teaching these topics, usually the kids are asking the wrong questions. 

They're confronted with a problem in their project and somehow end up focusing on some algorithm, data structure or technique in particular and they lose sight of the real problem.

Our conversations go something like this:

Student: How do I do filintheblank

Me: What are you trying to accomplish

Student: I'm trying to write fillintheblank

Me: No, what is the problem you're trying to solve.

Student looks confused.

We go back and forth for a bit until the student reveals the root problem that they're having and frequently this leads the student to both a deeper understanding of their problem and frequently an easier solution.
